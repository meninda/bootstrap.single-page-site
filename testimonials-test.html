                    is a incredible woman. Her actions are a reflection of what life is about; changing the lives of young
                    people by offering them hope, love, and a sense of identity. I admire her passion, as she has inspired
                    me to reach out into my own backyard to find ways to support others. Thank you Charlotte for being a
                    change agent in the community! May you continue to promote positive change in the lives of our young
